@doc

`poolgirl' is a lightweight, generic pooling library for Erlang with a
focus on simplicity, performance, and rock-solid disaster recovery.
It is `poolboy''s little sister, directed towards the use case of
simple workers that process requests with no need for a reply.

<h2>Usage</h2>

<pre>
1> Worker = poolgirl:checkout(PoolName).
&lt;0.9001.0&gt;
2> gen_server:call(Worker, Request).
ok
</pre>
